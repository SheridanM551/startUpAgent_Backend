Buying a home or remortgaging has never been harder. As the gap between earnings and house prices has grown to disproportionate levels, an entire generation of would-be buyers have been locked out of the property market, stuck renting or living in the family home. Those lucky enough to own are facing a volatile market and high interest rates, which threaten to increase their monthly outgoings by hundreds of pounds on average.

Here’s the catch. There’s more innovation out there than ever before to help. It’s just too fragmented and confusing for both consumers and intermediaries.

Tembo is an award-winning digital mortgage & savings platform, specialising in maximising affordability. Voted the UK’s Best Mortgage Broker by its customers at the British Bank Awards 2024, 2023 and 2022, Tembo combines technology and exceptional advice to help people discover and unlock their true borrowing potential.

We instantly scan over 100 lenders and 25 specialist buying schemes - from family boost mortgages where a loved one can support a mortgage using income, property or savings to shared ownership and interest-only deals - to increase budgets by an average £82,000.

In 2024 we launched into consumer savings products, now offering the market leading Lifetime ISA, to help our first-time buyers tackle one of the trickiest parts of the process: saving a deposit.

Tembo is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority under the registration number 952652. YOUR HOME MAY BE REPOSSESSED IF YOU DO NOT KEEP UP REPAYMENTS ON YOUR MORTGAGE.

Transforming transplantation with the OrganOx metra®. A transportable, automated ex vivo liver perfusion device.

The core technology employed by the OrganOx metra® has been in development for over 15 years. During this time both of the founders (Professor Peter Friend and Professor Constantin Coussios) have driven the development of organ preservation and maintenance, formerly at the University of Cambridge and latterly at the University of Oxford.

OrganOx Limited was founded in April 2008 as a spin-out from the University of Oxford.

Conventional cold preservation involves storage of the liver at 4˚C, using a non-physiological perfusion solution that aims to minimise liver decay. By contrast, warm preservation seeks to re-create an environment that mimics the human body by continuously perfusing at physiological pressures and flows with oxygen-carrying red cells at 37˚C and providing nutrition. The liver is therefore functional during the preservation period, producing bile, metabolizing glucose and maintaining a physiological pH. This enables objective assessment of organ performance prior to transplant, extended preservation times, and the potential use of organs that are presently being discarded.

Combining knowledge with experience, we motivate students to push the boundaries of innovation. However, more than anything, Pulse is a reminder of why we all chose to be engineers: for the opportunity to create impactful technology and push the world forward.

I feel like I can still learn things from the people that are around me… It really does have the environment of feeling like a salon, but being independent. And I think that that’s incredibly unique. Julee George IMAGE Studios Laguna Hills, CA Who really inspires me is Tim and Lisa (Mulks). I think the biggest part of my actual dream is to actually own one of these one day. Ever since the day I met them, it just clicked, and I respect them both as business owners and as people… It’s awesome here. I don’t remember how many times everybody that walks through the door sees that IMAGE Studios logo that’s right behind you. And then just looking at the ambience of the room, they’re just blown away… Jason Fuentes IMAGE Studios Sparks, NV Today is my one year anniversary. I can’t believe it’s only been a year. I feel like IMAGE Studios has been home to me. And it’s been such an amazing transition. I’ve loved taking my business into my own hands. And I’ve been so happy here. So it’s been awesome. And I signed another year… I’ve loved designing my own little suite. It’s been so much fun. I wanted to make sure it feels inclusive for everyone. Conlin Harwood IMAGE Studios Foothill, UT I looked at a bunch of different suites, and I was so worried about being isolated in a suite and not having anyone around, because a lot of them are very boxed in, where all the doors are closed and you’re walking through these hallways. But then I came to IMAGE Studios and it was like a breath of fresh air. With all the glass and everything, it just felt like a salon where everybody’s doing their own business. And that really drew me in. Keri Mills IMAGE Studios Laguna Hills, CA A lot of my clients that have followed me from my commission salon, or my employee based salon, love how private it is, they love the aesthetic of it, they feel really safe. It just feels like every time they come in, they’re looking at something new. They’re seeing other stylists through the glass windows, and they just say the energy here is amazing. And I feel it too. And I think all of us here affiliate as well. There’s just something so unique about this particular studio, like about IMAGE Studios specifically… I feel really at home here. I wish I did this sooner.

325357,633,EnergyX,Austin,United States,115,105,8.89,2018.0,179000000.0,Environmental,508,,Sustainability,"EnergyX is a sustainable energy company focused on direct lithium extraction, refinery and battery technology. Combining these technologies from brine to battery will create a process dramatically lowering the cost of lithium resources. The company’s goal is to develop technology and assets that turn it into one of the premier, low-cost lithium providers for the growing lithium-ion battery industry.

The electric vehicle (EV) and energy storage revolution is generating high demand for lithium, with some analysts forecasting orders-of-magnitude demand increases. As the EV market rapidly expands, millions of large-scale battery packs will be in demand. The estimated annual production of EV’s is 20,000,000 per year. For one 85-kWh car, the price of the lithium in the battery is approximately $2,945 per car. Residential (home) and commercial batteries are also gaining market demand traction, and California has implemented law stating by 2020 all new homes will require solar arrays.

Companies already producing lithium are attempting to increase production as battery cell manufacturers are scaling up lithium-ion production with mega factories and actively acquiring raw materials through long term off-take supply agreements. In the Lithium Triangle, where 50-70% of the world’s known lithium reserve is located, current methods of extraction are based off outdated, natural evaporation pond technology, which takes 18 months, and loses 50-70% of the lithium due to co-precipitation.

Our solution is to optimize and apply a highly scalable lithium extraction membrane to the process. The ability to efficiently extract and aggregate the lithium elements from the salt brines using proprietary, multi-level, synthetic ion separation techniques can increase time efficiency by 100x and recovery rate by 300%.

Entrepreneurs understand that corporate finance (divesting your business, looking for roll up or acquisition targets, licensing their technologies, or raising capital) although critical to the viability of the company, is fundamentally distracting. The entrepreneur's most significant contribution to creating enterprise value, we believe, is to focus on market validation through exceptional products, customer experiences, and talent to scale the business.

As such, EGL offers a unique approach to “Entrepreneurship Unfettered,” where entrepreneurs outsource the entire corporate finance function to EGL, as an extension of their senior leadership and board of advisors/directors. Founded in 1988 as a merchant banking firm, EGL has over 200 global capital raise, mergers, and acquisition advisory transactions to its credit. The firm’s resources, market reach, and extensive relationships include sourcing senior debt, subordinated debt, and equity for middle market clients, leverage, and management buyouts, as well as strategic partnerships and business development to materially enhance enterprise value.

The principals have extensive C-suite operating experience as company CEOs, COOs, CFOs, and Chief Revenue Officers (sales, marketing, and business development) and have managed three successful venture capital / private equity funds backed by US and European capital sources.

What types of solar panels does Gautam Solar manufacture? Gautam Solar specializes in advanced mono PERC and TOPCon solar panels, delivering high-efficiency photovoltaic modules for utility-scale and industrial applications. Our solar panel manufacturing lines integrate cutting-edge cell technologies to maximize energy yield and reliability. 2. What is TOPCon and Mono PERC technology? Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) is a next-generation solar cell architecture that enhances electron passivation for superior efficiency, commonly exceeding 23 % cell conversion rates. Mono PERC (Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell) employs a rear-side passivation layer to reduce electron recombination, boosting module performance in both residential and commercial solar panel manufacturing. 3. What is the efficiency of Gautam Solarâs solar cells? Our TOPCon solar technology modules routinely achieve efficiencies above 22 %, outperforming standard multicrystalline panels and ensuring optimal return on investment for large-scale solar EPC projects. By leveraging mono PERC advancements, we deliver market-leading performance across varied climate conditions. 4. Where are Gautam Solarâs manufacturing facilities located? Gautam Solar operates state-of-the-art factories in Haridwar and Bhiwani, Haryana, with plans to expand capacity by 5 GWp by the end of 2025. Our EPC-aligned infrastructure supports turnkey solar panel manufacturing and solar project execution for EPC clients nationwide. 5. How does Gautam Solar ensure quality and detect panel defects? Gautam Solar employs AI-driven defect detection systems during production to identify micro-cracks, soldering faults, and material inconsistencies in real time. Post-manufacturing, each panel undergoes electroluminescence and thermal imaging inspections to uphold our strict solar panel manufacturing quality standards. 6. How do I maintain Gautam Solar panels for optimal performance? Our solar panel maintenance recommendations include periodic cleaning to remove dust, debris, and pollens, plus annual electrical inspections to verify wiring integrity and inverter performance. Implementing remote monitoring systems enables real-time performance analytics and proactive issue detection for large-scale solar EPC installations. 7. What is the expected degradation rate of Gautam Solar panels and how does it impact long-term performance? Gautam Solarâs mono PERC and TOPCon modules exhibit an industry-leading median degradation rate of approximately 1% for the first year and then 0.4% per year, ensuring over 90 % of rated power output even after 20 years of operation. This low annual decline translates to 80â90 % power retention at the end of a 25-year service life, minimizing energy yield loss for large-scale and utility-scale solar EPC projects Enquire Now Email info@gautamsolar.com Service Support 1800-532-0800 WhatsApp +91 9311797248 Submit enquiry Name: Email: Mobile Number: State: Willing to invest: Select your investment More than Rs. 10 Crores Rs. 1 Crores to 10 Crores Rs. 10 Lacs to 1 Crores Rs 1 Lacs to 10 Lacs Less than Rs. 1 Lac Remarks: Send Message Company Home About Us Solar Modules â N-type TOPCon Modules â Mono PERC Modules Solar Power Plants Quick Links Blogs Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Contact D-120-121, Okhla Industrial Area, Phase-1, New Delhi-110020 +91 93117 97248 info@gautamsolar.com This website uses cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our website.

KHC is an international advisory services firm with deep multi-industry expertise and an extraordinary network. With offices in New York and London, we partner with leading companies in their search for world-class talent, modern organization design and brand development strategies that serve today’s complex business needs. Our approach dismantles the divides between disciplines and industries, supporting leaders in new ways of working, thinking and remaining relevant for the future. Founded and led by entrepreneur Karen Harvey, known for her ability to see around corners and predict industry trends, our advisory services work has become equally important to our renowned practice, placing top talent.

In 2012, we recognized a rapidly evolving world where fashion and retail leaders needed a bridge to the technology sector, to mitigate their disparate approaches and improve their ability to innovate together. In the process of education, immersion and determining how we could play a role, we reshaped our business. We expanded our network with new talent, exceptional leaders and powerful ideas that when applied with a strategic lens, could reinvent traditional business. This then led to the launch of our industry leading platforms, Fashion Tech Forum and INDX. Today, FTF creates a space for visionaries, innovators and those driving the conversation across industries and culture. INDX connects emerging creatives with progressive brands for employment opportunities and knowledge sharing partnerships.
